PHP-like variable interpolation inside of the string.

Just use it like this:

echo("Testing i=$i j=$j");

You can also escape $ or use more complicated expressions:

echo("Escaping: \\$j, Complicated i+j=${i+j}, just works");


echo uses stdio.writefln, so currently there is only possible to use Phobos,
and output to the stdout.

TODO:
  - 2 pass algorithm to detect types, and do not depend on writefln("%s"),
    RTIA type detection, as it is not "the-right-way", and is slower.
